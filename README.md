# Translator
This project is a simple translator from Kotlin to C. It works only for a subset of Kotlin language.
## Usage
Clone the repository and run main function from KotlinToCTranslator class, paste your code into standard input when promped, and finish writing with EOF (ctrl d on most devices). 
The code in C will be printed on the standard output.
## Example
Example code is avaliable in the file [example.kt](src/main/resources/example.kt) - feel free to copy it and paste into the program. Below there is the result of inserting this file:


![example](src/main/resources/Example%20usage.png?raw=true)
